# Weather-Dashboard
In order  to see the weather outlook for multiple cities building a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Here the OpenWeather One Call API is used to retrieve weather data for cities. 

# HTML and CSS
Since there was no starter code for this assignment the first step was to create an HTML file and do the basic CSS styling. 

# Search Button
Users should be able to search the cities in the form element and it should return them results with current and future conditions for that city.

# 5-day forecast
WHile searching for the current weather conditions for thi city the user should also be able to see 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

# UV - Index button
The UV Index button is supposed to change the color indicating whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

# Storage
The search history should be displayed as buttons below the search form and on clicking on a city in the search history urrent and future conditions for that city should be presented.
